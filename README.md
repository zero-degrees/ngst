This is a seed application that contains a [Koa.js](http://koajs.com/) API and an [Angular 4](http://angular.io) UI.  The UI is based on [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

## Installation

1. First make sure that you have Node.js installed
2. Run `./install.sh`
3. Modify the values in **config.json** to match your environment

## Usage

To start the application, run `./start.sh` -- this will start the servers for both the API and UI. Any changes to either should be effective almost immediately without restarting.
